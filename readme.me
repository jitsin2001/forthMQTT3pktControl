Early test code for a mecrisp forth connected to ESP-Link
Dont't expect those examples to do anyting of value.
But maybe they will blow your house or shoot your mother in law - who knows?


Goal in the end:
simple double setpoint control
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-setpoint_control
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreipunktregler

Which supposed to control the pressure in my heating system
(as some next-to-hello-word example for more complicated IoT tasks)
- read pressure analog in
- agitate relief valve if pressure is too high
- agitate fill pump if pressure is too low
- send notice on any action by MQTT (mosquitto) to home automation (FHEM - planned)
- query pressure and status by MQTT / home automation
- set switch levels and maybe other constants by MQTT


My setup
- Blue pill STM32F103-whatever Controller (cheap China clone)
- Mecrisp-Stellaris RA 2.4.8 for STM32F103 by Matthias Koch
- Wemos D1 mini ESP8266 ESP-12 based china clone
- esp-link v2.2.3 - 2016-06-21 21:58:48 - 1bcdc62
- wlan and (not really simple) home network, of course
- jeelabs embello folie v1 terminal program

Basic steps:

- flash ESP-Link to ESP  (esptool.py)
- folie -p /dev/ttyUSB0 ... watch WiFI setup, connect to AP, set your SSID and switch to station mode
- flash mecrisp to the bluepill
- optional: play with FORTH over a serial line first
- connect bluepill to ESP (same breadboard), with a cheap 5-V-mobile charger for power
- attach a chinese-2-channel-relais-card and apotentiometer to simulate pressure input
- implement a double-setpoint control which is a quite straightforward FORTH-exercise
- digital-I/O, ADC, tasks.....
- try to get MQTT running

A running example for ESP-Link with forth where I picked up much of MQTT low level info:

RTFS if you can't RTFM due to nonexitence
This is a C-client that is delivered to implement MQTT over ESP-Lib
So I have to implement a subset of its functionality
